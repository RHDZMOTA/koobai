There are two main configurations to provide:
* **Character Configurations**
* **Book Configurations**

## FAQ

**Why are characters decouple from book configurations?** Let's think about this. You can define a character (attributes, skills, motivations) regardless of the story you want to tell. In fact, you can even have the same character "go through" different story lines. Having characters decoupled from the book itself allows us to start with a pure representation of the character (i.e., pure & reusable) and then "drag them along" a storyline, resulting on a different character evolution for each story.
