Olivia joined Project SENTINEL to study the potential effects of advanced AI on human cognition, unaware of the full scope of the project. Her role is to ensure that any AI developed would be safe and beneficial to humans, focusing on the ethical implications of the technology. When she first meets Ethan, sheâ€™s intrigued by his intellect and dedication but is also concerned by his apparent detachment from those around him.

As she works alongside Ethan, though in different areas of the project, Olivia becomes increasingly interested in him, not just professionally but personally. She senses his loneliness and isolation and tries to reach out to him, though Ethan initially keeps his distance, focused solely on his work.
