# Koobai: Character Configs

Each character initial state is defined by a set of files containing different elements that "build" the character.

Currently, a character is defined with the following files:
* YAML (Structured) Files:
    * `basics.yaml`
    * `appearance.yaml`
* Text (Unstructured) Files:
    * `background.txt`
    * `backstory.txt`
    * `motivations.txt`
    * `personality_traits.txt`
    * `skills.txt`
    * `weaknesses.txt`
