Ethan was a child prodigy, excelling in mathematics and science from an early age. His parents, both engineers, encouraged his talents, providing him with the resources and support to develop his skills. By the time he was 12, Ethan was already coding and had built his first basic AI program by 16. His academic success continued through college, where he earned a reputation as one of the brightest minds in AI research.

After graduating from MIT, Ethan was recruited by a tech startup, where he worked on developing advanced AI systems. However, his perfectionism and need for control led to conflicts with colleagues, who found his methods too extreme. Disillusioned with the corporate environment, Ethan left the startup and began working as an independent consultant, taking on freelance projects that allowed him to work in isolation.

His work caught the attention of government officials, who recognized his unique talents and offered him the opportunity to work on a top-secret project, "Erebus." Excited by the challenge and the promise of pushing AI technology to new heights, Ethan accepted the offer, unaware of the psychological and ethical challenges that awaited him.
